# Welcome to Dynamic Web Applications!

In this course, students will bridge the gap between client and server, building dynamic web application front-ends powered by back-end servers. 


### PROGRAM GOALS

The following IDM program goals are reinforced within this course. At an undergraduate level, students will:

* 1 – develop **conceptual thinking skills** to generate ideas and content in order to solve problems or create opportunities.
  * Students will develop a personal development practice through inquiry and iteration.
* 2 – develop **technical skills** to realize their ideas.
  * Students will understand and utilize tools and technology, while adapting to constantly changing technological paradigms by learning how to learn.
  * Students will be able to integrate/interface different technologies within a technological ecosystem.
* 3 – develop **critical thinking skills** that will allow them to analyze and position their work within cultural, historic, aesthetic, economic, and technological contexts.
* 4 – gain knowledge of **professional practices and organizations** by developing their verbal, visual, and written communication for product demonstration, project and expectation management, and business process optimization.



### COURSE GOALS

This course will reinforce or introduce students to:
* Dynamic front-end development using Javascript
* Server application development to support a web front-end
* version control through git and github
* mobile web user interaction and development
* current content management system platforms 

This course will help students to:
* understand application development process from conception to launch
* develop a vocabulary to evaluate and critique web applications


### LEARNING OUTCOMES

By the end of the course, students will be able to
* scope and implement a professional-quality web application.
* understand and implement the iterative process
* learn how to proactively learn also known as self-regulated learning
  * In any learning situation, you should study beforehand, make/do, debug, reflect, adjust, and do it all over again (iteration). Learning happens in a cycle.
* interact with other developers in both collaborative and competitive environments


### COURSE STRUCTURE

Class will be comprised of lectures, application product demos, and working production labs. There will be weekly homework assignments that students will present to the class, a midterm project and demo, and a final project and demo. We will also have a guest speaker (Date to be determined, depending on their schedule). 

The course will be structured around a particular intent - to develop a web application product for a paying client, in order to optimize their business. The focus will be on delivering working products developed from an agreed-upon specification, creating follow-on products from initial deliverables, and iterating on product intent while limiting change in the system. Clarity of purpose and attention to economic concerns is essential.

Demos are the best way to articulate your ideas and products to others and get immediate feedback. During a demo, the professor and your classmates analyze and suggest ways to improve the efficiency, look and feel, and accuracy of your product in relation to its goals. Take notes when your demo is being discussed and do not edit the responses, whether you agree with them or not. Review your demo notes and reflect upon what was said. Ask yourself how you could combine, transform, or expand the ideas that show the most promise. However, resist the temptation to incorporate all suggestions and comments. Only utilize the ones that work for you and your project. 

Rules of a Demo:
* Be Present and Engaged
* Give Feedback to your classmates
* Do NOT take feedback personally.

Students will conduct self assessments, as well as receiving evaluation by the professor during or after midterm and at the end of the semester. 

### COMMUNICATING WITH THE PROFESSOR OUTSIDE OF CLASS

* Instead of email we will be using Slack, https://dmuy3193-dwa.slack.com/messages/general/, for communication and sharing files (that are NOT HTML or CSS. i.e. pdfs, pngs, jpgs, gifs, etc.)
* Direct Message on Slack about logistics (when, where, how many?) ONLY
* Talk to me in person directly before or after class OR set up an appointment about issues and problems. 
* **DO NOT email (or direct message on Slack) long conversations. If your message turns into paragraphs that means you should be talking to me in person.**

### STUDENT RESPONSIBILITIES

* Schedule your time (keep a calendar of some sort) 
* Come to class on time and participate (be present and engaged)
* Study outside of class (ideally with classmate(s) i.e. Form a Study Group or Team), devoting **at a minimum 6 to 12 hours per week outside of class**, fulfilling homework assignments, reading, and studying concepts covered in class.
* **Back up your work constantly**
* Consult slack and github at least once a week for up to date info
* Complete all assignments by due dates

### STUDENT VALUES
* Action – do your absolute best
* Strive for continuous improvement
* Pay attention to detail & craft
* Have desire amounting to enthusiasm (to learn, to explore)
* Have self-motivation, proactiveness, and focus 
* Have patience, persistence, and discipline 
* Be creative
* Have self-confidence and pride in your work
* Have fun!

### EVALUATION & GRADING

##### Attendance

* Attendance is mandatory and will be taken at the beginning of every class. Since there is so much technical, conceptual, and design information to absorb, regular attendance is essential.
* Unexcused absences will affect your grade. One absence is allowed; after that, your final, overall, numerical grade will drop by 5 percent (1/2 a grade point (e.g. A to an A-)) for each additional absence.
* Be on Time. Tardiness will affect your grade. For every 15 minutes of tardiness, your final, numerical grade will drop by 0.625 percent
* Contact the professor **at least 24 hours in advance** if you will not be in class (in person or via direct message on slack is preferred).
* Attendance is mandatory for the midterm and final presentations.

#### Your final grade will be based on a synthesis of quantitative & qualitative rubrics:

##### Quantitative Grading Overview

* 5% Github Documentation
* 5% Midterm Self-Assessment
* 10% Project Plan
* 10% Final Self-Assessment
* 10% Learning Logs (A total of at least 12)
* 30% Midterm Project
* 30% Final Project


##### Midterm and Final Grading Overview

* 40% Participation in the **mandatory** class critique
* 20% Information Design
* 20% Interaction Design
* 20% Application Architecture


##### Qualitative Grading Overview

Each student will be judged on the quality, experimentation, and improvement that their work shows.

###### A. Excellent (90-100)
Performance, participation, and attendance of the student has been
of the highest level, showing sustained excellence in meeting course responsibilities. Work clearly differentiates itself from other work, has memorable impact, pursues concepts and techniques above and beyond what is discussed in class. The student thoroughly understands the web design and development process.

###### B. Very Good / Good (80-89)
Performance, participation, and attendance of the student has been good, though not of the highest level. Work demonstrates a better than average web design and development process.

###### C. Satisfactory (70-79)
Performance and attendance of the student has been adequate, satisfactorily meeting the course requirements. Work is average and competent, showing a basic understanding of the web design and development process.

###### D. Poor; Below Average (60-69)
Performance and attendance of the student has been less than adequate. Work is lacking in many or most areas that show any understanding of visual foundation. Problems may include lack of interest, procrastination, poor planning and poor craft.

###### F. Unacceptable (59 & Below)
Performance and attendance of the student has been such that course requirements have not been met. Work shows no overall understanding of the course material on many levels or either a severe lack of interest.

### TECHNOLOGY USE IN THE CLASSROOM

This class is about web development principles and technology. Through lectures & demos, we will cover many important technical issues, but—as in the professional world—the burden of technology will always lie squarely on the designer's/developer's shoulders. Community tech sharing is highly advised as well. I have listed several helpful resources to help you in getting up to speed with technology within the syllabus and on github. 

Laptop computers and other mobile devices are invaluable tools for designers, developers, and students when used responsibly. However, this technology can also be incredibly distracting, especially in the classroom. When in class, you may use your laptops and other devices for any activities pertaining to the course: taking notes, researching material relevant to our readings and discussions, doing Dynamic Web Applications homework, making class presentations, etc. However, the following uses are unacceptable: checking email, instant messaging, texting, using social networking sites such as facebook, tumblr, etc.  Also, during class screenings, your laptops should not be used.


### ACADEMIC HONESTY

All work for this class must be your own and specific to this semester. Any work recycled from other classes or from another, non-original source will be rejected with serious implications for the student. Plagiarism, knowingly representing the words or ideas of another as one's own work in any academic exercise, is absolutely unacceptable. Any student who commits plagiarism must re-do the assignment for a grade no higher than a D. In fact, a D is the highest possible course grade for any student who commits plagiarism. Please use the MLA style for citing and documenting source material.   


### ACADEMIC ACCOMMODATIONS
